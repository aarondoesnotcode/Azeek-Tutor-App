# Azeek Tutoring Application

This is a fullstack application built for my tutoring business. It utilizes **Python** and **Django** for the backend, and **JavaScript** with **React** for the frontend. Additionally, the application implements the **Django REST Framework** and **JWT tokens** for authentication and API management.

## Technology Stack:
- **Backend**: Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, React
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token)

I have successfully developed this application by integrating these technologies and learning through the process.

## Learning Notes
